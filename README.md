## Marketing / CRMs

- Tribed
  -  It’s a user dashboard where you can see exactly what’s going on with your product and also a Gmail marketing automation tool. All of my projects’ welcome emails, “Come back to us” emails, and user event-based emails are sent from my own Gmail account (I use google aliases) and always reach the inbox of my users.
- Tawk.to
  - Live chat + contact form for your website that’s super fast and has great UI and robust customization options. They also offer automation, so if visitors are on a specific page for a specific duration, you can start a conversation with them automatically.
- FreshDesk
  - Great support CRM, has a lot of integrations, the one I like most is their Twitter integration that allows you to automatically get DMs as tickets. They also offer a mobile app which is a great plus for answering tickets on-the-go.
- Google Optimize
  - Free AB testing platform with an amazing Chrome browser to help you set up AB test of your active site by simply clicking and editing your site and saving that as a variation. Test your landing pages / front page for better conversions without a single line of code.
  
## Domains / Hosting

- Namecheap
  - Cheap domains with free WHOIS guard and a robust DNS editor. They also have coupons active all the time. A short google search will provide a coupon.
- DigitalOcean
  - It probably doesn’t need mentioning, but just in case- In my opinion, the best VPS host out there. It starts at just $5 for a 1 CPU server.

## Analytics

- HotJar
  - Great tool for website heatmaps and visitor video recording. They have a lot more robust options but most of those are unusable in the free-tier. I love watching my website visitors scrolling away and reading with their mouse cursor.
- Google Analytics
